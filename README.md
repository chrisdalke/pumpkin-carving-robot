# Pumpkin Carving Robot

A robot that carves pumpkins! This robot is a Grbl-based CNC machine that uses a rotary table mechanism to cut patterns in pumpkins. It was built in October 2021 by [Andrew Gutierrez](http://andrewtgutierrez.com/) and [Chris Dalke](https://www.chrisdalke.com/). Its results range from hilariously bad to pretty cool!
